# What If

## What is it?
This is a website where you will face hypothetical scenarios (what if), and you can enter your thoughts for each of them.

After you enter your thought, you will be able to view what other user's have said, and compare your thoughts to their's!

I originally made this website in Flask (Python) about a year ago, but I decided to remake it in Next.js.
